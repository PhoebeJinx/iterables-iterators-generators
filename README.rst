Iterables, Iterators, Generators Presentation
---------------------------------------------

This is a presentation I am preparing for the Ottawa Python Authors Group
on January 24, 2013.

The presentation consists of an ipython notebook and supporting diagrams.

The included Makefile can generate the diagrams using Graphviz, and it
can extract the portions of the presentation that make a complete,
working python application as rps_server.py.
